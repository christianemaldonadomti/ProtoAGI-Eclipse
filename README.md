# ProtoAGI's Eclipse 2024 Prediction ML

## Introduction
ProtoAGI's Eclipse ML is a machine learning application developed by the ProtoAGI system, designed to predict the path of solar eclipses with high accuracy. ProtoAGI, which stands for Prototype Artificial General Intelligence, is a novel AGI simulation system characterized by its dynamic learning capabilities and a modular, scalable architecture. Unlike conventional AI, it integrates a self-enhancing knowledge base for iterative learning and adapts its algorithms based on accumulated knowledge and interaction with users.

## About ProtoAGI
ProtoAGI is a systemic approach to artificial intelligence that leverages the integration of various AI components and engineering principles to solve complex problems. It operates on a framework that allows for the emulation of human-like intelligence and reasoning within a machine learning context. ProtoAGI represents a step forward in the field of AGI by offering adaptable, scalable, and intelligent solutions that are grounded in ethical AI practices.

## Eclipse Prediction
The Eclipse ML script is a proof of concept demonstrating ProtoAGI's potential. Utilizing a dataset fetched from NASA's public API, the script employs advanced machine learning techniques to predict the solar eclipse path for 2024. It leverages latitude and longitude data from multiple locations, different from those in the dataset, to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability. The prediction model, built using TensorFlow, processes the data and outputs the anticipated path the eclipse will take, demonstrating the practical application of ProtoAGI's AI methodology.

## Installation
To run the Eclipse ML script, you will need Python and the following libraries: pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn. Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn
